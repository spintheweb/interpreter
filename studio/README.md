# Spin the Web Studio

Spin the Web Studio is a software for managing Spin the Web sites. In this context, sites may be web sites, portals, intranet, extranets, web apps or web services.

The difference between a regular site and a Spin the Web site is the presence of a *WBDL* file (Webbase Description Language) and, naturally, the site is hosted in a server running a Web Spinner. The WBDL file describes the site: its contents, routing, authorization and internationalization.

Spin the Web Studio is a GUI for managing WBDL.
