Spin the Web deals with the Webbase Ontology Language (WBOL)—pronounced like wobble /ˈwɒbəl/. Simply put, HTML describes a web page, WBOL, a web site; and, while HTML is interpreted by a client side web browser, WBOL, by a server side web spinner. It is this project opinion that WBOL is a missing component in the World Wide Web space.

It must be stressed that WBOL does not replace any technology, it coordinates technologies; it focuses on contents, defining what they are, how they are organized, and where, how and when they are rendered. Web spinners output contents on request.

WBOL can describe web sites, intranets, extranets, portals, web apps, web services, here collectively referred to as webos. It is a fundamental language for Content Management Systems (CMS).

The term webbase was first used in 1998, a name given to a relational database whose schema defined a webo: its structure, content, layout, localization, navigation and security aspects. Later, to ease portability, the webbase was formalized into the XML based Webbase Ontology Language (WBOL), this introduced the term webbaselet, a webbase fragment.


## Features
* Centered on contents
* Role Based Access Control
* Multilingual & Multinational
* Templated
* Extensible

## Rendering paradigm
A user may request a single content or page (collection of contents), via HTTP GET coded in the URL, if an area is requested, Spin the Web responds with the area's main page. If the requested page is not available Spin the Web responds with the home page.
If the requested content is not available an empty response is returned (200 OK).
At least one of the roles that the user is part of needs to be authorized to the content or page requested.
Role based authorization is inherited, the guests role is authorized, by default, to view only the home page.
