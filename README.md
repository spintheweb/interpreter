Spin the Web deals with the Webbase Ontology Language (WBOL)—pronounced like wobble /ˈwɒbəl/. Simply put, HTML describes a web page, WBOL, a web site; and, while HTML is interpreted by a client side web browser, WBOL, by a server side _web spinner_. It is this project opinion that WBOL is a missing component in the World Wide Web space.

It must be stressed that WBOL does not replace any technology, it coordinates technologies; it focuses on _contents_ (rendered data units), defining what they are, how they are organized, and where, how and when they are rendered. Web spinners output contents on request.

WBOL can describe web sites, intranets, extranets, portals, web apps, web services, here collectively referred to as webos. It is a fundamental language for Content Management Systems (CMS). 

The term webbase was first used in 1998, a name given to a relational database whose schema defined a webo: its structure, content, layout, localization, navigation and security aspects. Later, to ease portability, the webbase was formalized into the XML based Webbase Ontology Language (WBOL), this introduced the term webbaselet, a webbase fragment.
