# Spin the Web

Spin the Web deals with the Webbase Ontology Language (WBOL)—pronounced like wobble /ˈwɒbəl/. Simply put, HTML describes a web page, WBOL, a web site; and, while HTML is interpreted by a client side web browser, WBOL, by a server side _web spinner_. It is this project opinion that WBOL is a missing component in the World Wide Web space.

It must be stressed that WBOL does not replace any technology, it coordinates technologies; it focuses on _contents_ (rendered data units), defining what they are, how they are organized, and where, how and when they are rendered. Web spinners output contents on request.

WBOL can describe web sites, intranets, extranets, portals, web apps, web services, here collectively referred to as webos. It is a fundamental language for Content Management Systems (CMS). 

The term _webbase_ was first used in 1998, a name given to a relational database whose schema defined a webo: its structure, content, layout, localization, navigation and security aspects. Later, to ease portability, the webbase was formalized into the XML based Webbase Ontology Language (WBOL), this introduced the term _webbaselet_, a webbase fragment.

## Elements 
Spin the Web addresses three issues to ease web develpments: describe, interpret and build. It is based on pillars of web development, HTML (SVG), CSS, Javascript, to name a few, it is not for the faint of heart, a good dose of knowhow is necessary, full stack development knowhow.

A _webbase_ is an hierachically organized structure of three base elements, plus one: _areas_, _pages_ and _contents_, the additional element is _reference_, it points to any of the three base elements; at the root of the hierarchy there is always a fifth element named _webo_. The file system analogy may be of help: the _webo_ is the drive, _areas_ are folders, _pages_ are files, _contents_ and _references_, well, they are something else! Like the file system, a webbase also addresses security, role level security, based on a simple inherited visibility paradigm.

_Contents_ are special, they come in four flavors: _navigational_, _organizational_, _presentational_ and _special_. The purpose of contents is to allow _interaction_ with data of any kind, they request data, provide data, they can be simple microservices, dashbords they are described macroscopically by (WBOL) Webbase Ontology Language and microscopically (WBLL) Webbase Layout Language
